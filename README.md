In olden days we had transistors which occupies rooms. Now a single chip can contains billions of transistors. This is the evolution that happened from the olden days from transistor level to the gate level to the RTL to the Behavioral model.

So, the RTL can be converted to the Gate-level which is called 'logic synthesis' which can be done through EDA tools and then the gate-level can be converted to the transistor level which is called the 'physical synthesis'.
In combinational logic we need understand to represent adders, multipliers, encoders, etc and also to represent the numbers.
In sequential logic we need to understand about storing elements like FFs, registers, counters, etc. Also we should understand that it operates on clock. The combinational logic is the input of the sequential logic. Then we have FSMs which is used for the control purpose. So, if we combine this 3, that will constitute the digital system.
